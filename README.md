This project uses R and Python to analyse road traffic collision data provided as part of "stats19". 

Each file is numbered as to the order it should be run. Whilst some files can run independent of one another, others may require prequisite actions before it can be used. This is clearly noted at the top of each file. 

Python version 3.12 has been used as it is the lates version that TS supports. Conda environments have been created though VENV will work just as well. 

In order to create the conda environment the following command(s) can be run:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Check the environment has been successfully created:
`conda env list`

Activate the environment:
`conda activate <envname>`

conda env create -f environment.yml
